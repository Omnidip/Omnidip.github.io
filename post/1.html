<h1>SQL Chess ♞</h1>
<p>
I have always been fascinated by chess. As a game I don’t find chess especially entertaining; I find it lacking breadth. But for what is lacks in breadth
it more than makes up for in depth. People can spend their entire lives dedicated to the game and still be constantly learning new things. Each minute
detail can be broken down then built into hundreds of different strategies, fanning out turn by turn into a countable but unfathomably large 
number of possible different board states. One of my favorite things is emergent complexity derived from a very simple 
set of rules. Chess is a perfect example of such a system. Yet, even through all of this complexity, you could fit the rules of chess onto a single side 
of an 8.5’x11’ sheet of paper with space to spare.

This project started as a way to see how I could push SQL using triggers as my main logical operator, 
but it also serves as an exploration of the simple complexity of chess. Thrown together over the course of a weekend, the base rules of chess 
fit into around 1000 lines of SQLite code, using 0 join statement and 0 if statements (along with a small amount of C exclusively to provide a more user 
friendly interface, you are able play entirely through SQL commands, it is just cumbersome). For anyone else wanting to tread this path,
be forewarned; This was no fun to debug. </br></br>
The current version must be played by two players. I may try to add an AI in the future.</br></br>
